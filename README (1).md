#Coursera Guided Project
Repository for the "Climate Geospatial Analysis with Python and Xarray" of Amazon Rain Forest.
I have Used NetCdf data.Data contains longitude,latitude,expver and time.
Data variables are
lai_hv - vegetation
skt - surface temperature
tp - total precipitation
data containes from 1979-01-01 to 2019-01-01


Project Structure
The hands on project on Climate Geospatial Analysis with Python and Xarray is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Load and getting familiar with NetCDF datasets
Task 2: Select and filter data through coordinates
Task 3: Visualize multidimensional and geospatial variables
Task 4: Apply simple operations over multidimensional data
Task 5: Apply grouped operations over multidimensional data
Task 6: Merge and concatenate datasets
Task 7: Interact with Pandas and export datasets
